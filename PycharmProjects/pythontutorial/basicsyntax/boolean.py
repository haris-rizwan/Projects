"""
Boolean is a binary it only has two values 1 or 0

boolean works as a switch which has only two values on and off

any value of object which is null or zero means it is false
any value of object which 1 or greater is always true.
in a variable space is also a true value.

see the examples below

"""

a = "some value"

print (a)

# value of variable in a is " some value " now we will see the boolean of a

print ("**********")

print(bool(a))

# boolean of a returns as true because it has some value .

print("*#*#*#*#*#*#*#")

b = ""
print(b)

# b variable has no value in qoutes so its did not print any thing now check the boolean of b

print(bool(b))

# space between the qoutes of any variable is also a value which will return true boolean see example

print ("see the sapce example")

c = " "

print(bool(c))
